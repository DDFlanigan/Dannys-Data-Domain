## About
Thank you for checking out my portfolio! My name is Danny. I am currently a Research Scientist in the Biotechnology sector. I hold both a BSc and a MSc in Biomedical Engineering. I have worked on some amazing projects in this field that have pushed me to continuously learn and develop new skills. Most recently, I have decided to turn that desire to learn toward Data Analytics.

Through my years in research, I have grown a strong proclivity for data analysis. Interpreting complex data to come to meaningful conclusions that drive progress is my favorite aspect of my job.  I wanted to lean further into this and gain technical skills that will allow me to efficiently handle, analyze and visualize large amounts of data. Naturally, this lead me to my pursuit of Data Analytics.

In this repository you will find a collection of projects showcasing my proficiency with tools like SQL, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI and my ability draw meaningful insights from large and diverse datasets. I thoroughly enjoyed putting this together. I hope you enjoy reviewing it and getting to know me and how I think! Feel free to reach out - I would love to discuss my projects with you.
